## Implementing a Firewall with IPTables on Linux

Project Description:

Set up and configure a basic firewall using IPTables on a Linux server. This project involves configuring basic and advanced IPTables rules, including NAT and port forwarding, and setting up logging and monitoring.

## 1. Install and Configure IPTables
   
Before I can use IPTables to manage network traffic, I need to ensure itâ€™s installed on your system. Basic configuration involves setting default policies to control traffic flow and establishing rules to allow necessary connections while blocking unwanted traffic.

## 1.2 Basic Configuration of IPTablesCommands:
In this project, I configured a basic set of iptables rules to secure a Linux system. IPTables is a powerful firewall tool that allows for packet filtering and network address translation in Linux. The following commands were used to establish a baseline firewall configuration, which ensures that only specific types of traffic are allowed while everything else is blocked. This configuration is essential for protecting a system from unauthorized access and potential attacks.
