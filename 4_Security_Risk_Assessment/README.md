## 1. Project Overview 

### Objective:

•	Perform a comprehensive security risk assessment on a corporate network.

•	Identify and analyze potential security risks.

•	Implement network hardening techniques to mitigate identified vulnerabilities.

•	Improve the overall security posture of the network.

### Target Audience:

•	Cybersecurity professionals and potential employers in Austria and the EU.

•	Organizations aiming to comply with security standards like ISO 27001, NIS Directive, or IEC 62443.

## 2. Define the Scope and Environment

### Step 1: Define the Company Environment

•	Company Name: SecureNet GmbH

•	Industry: Technology Solutions

•	Location: Vienna, Austria

•	Network Size: 200 employees, multiple offices across Europe.

•	IT Infrastructure:

o	Network: LAN, WAN, and VPN.

o	Servers: Web servers, application servers, database servers.

o	Security Devices: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), VPN gateways.

## Step 2: Scope of the Assessment

•	Network Components: Internal LAN, WAN, VPN connections, and firewalls.

•	Data Sensitivity: Customer data, internal communications, and proprietary software.

•	Assessment Focus: Network vulnerabilities, risk to critical assets, and potential attack vectors.

## 3. Perform a Security Risk Assessment

### Step 1: Identify Assets and Their Importance

#### •	Critical Assets:

o	Customer Database: Contains sensitive customer information.

o	Email Servers: Handles all internal and external communications.

o	Web Servers: Public-facing servers hosting company applications.

## Step 2: Identify Threats and Vulnerabilities

•	Threat Source 1: External attackers (e.g., hackers, cybercriminals).
•	Threat Source 2: Insider threats (e.g., disgruntled employees).
•	Threat Source 3: Network misconfigurations (e.g., unpatched servers).

## Step 3: Vulnerability Scanning

# Network security assessment project using Nmap. 

We are performing a network security assessment for a small business. Our objective is to identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities on the company's network. You will use Nmap to conduct this assessment.

## 1. Define our Scope
   
•	Targets: IP address range of the company's network (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

•	Objective: Identify open ports, services, and any potential vulnerabilities.

## 2. Basic Network Scan

First, identify which hosts are up in the target range.

## 3. Service Version Detection

Detect the services and their versions running on a specific host (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

## 4. Vulnerability Scanning with NSE

We Run Nmap’s Scripting Engine to detect vulnerabilities.

 # 1.Summary of Findings

### Host Information:

•	IP Address: 192.168.1.1

### •	Services Detected:

o	Port 53/tcp: DNS (dnsmasq 2.80)

o	Port 80/tcp: HTTP (GoAhead WebServer 2.5.0)

o	Port 5555/tcp: Filtered (freeciv)

## Vulnerabilities Detected:

## •	Port 80/tcp:

o	Possible CSRF vulnerabilities (found using http-csrf)

o	Source code disclosure (found using http-litespeed-sourcecode-download)

 ## 3. Implement Network Hardening Techniques
 
### 1. Network Segmentation

#### •	Segment DNS and Web Services:

o	Place the DNS server and web server on separate VLANs to minimize exposure.

### 2. Firewall Configuration

####•	Firewall Rules:

o	DNS Server (Port 53): Allow only necessary traffic (e.g., from internal network).

o	Web Server (Port 80): Restrict access to known IPs or networks, and block unnecessary ports.

o	Port 5555: Block or monitor traffic if it’s not required.

### 3. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
   
#### •	Deploy IDS/IPS:

o	Configure IDS to monitor DNS and HTTP traffic for suspicious activity.

o	Set up IPS rules to prevent known exploits targeting the GoAhead WebServer.

### 5. Access Control

#### •	Web Server Access:

o	Implement strong authentication for any admin interfaces.

o	Use ACLs (Access Control Lists) to limit who can manage or access DNS settings.

### 6. Network Monitoring

#### •	Set Up Monitoring:

o	Use tools like Nagios or Zabbix to monitor traffic to and from DNS and web servers.

o	Configure alerts for unusual activities on ports 53 and 80.

### 7. Patch Management

#### •	Update DNS and Web Server Software:

o	Regularly check for and apply updates for dnsmasq and GoAhead WebServer.

o	Use automated tools or check vendor sites for patches.

### 8. Secure Configuration

##### •	DNS Server:

o	Ensure that DNS configurations are secure and limit recursion to trusted sources.

#### •	Web Server:

o	Review and harden web server configurations to avoid common vulnerabilities.

### 9. Encryption

#### •	Use HTTPS for Web Traffic:

o	If feasible, configure the web server to use HTTPS instead of HTTP to encrypt data in transit.

### 10. Network Access Control (NAC)

#### •	Restrict Network Access:

o	Ensure only authorized devices can connect to critical services.

### 11. Regular Security Assessments

#### •	Scheduled Scans:

o	Perform regular vulnerability scans to identify new issues.

#### •	Penetration Testing:

o	Conduct penetration tests to assess the effectiveness of the implemented security measures.
